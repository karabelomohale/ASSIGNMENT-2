**Objective:**
The primary goal is to develop a Tamagotchi app that replicates the experience of the original 1990s virtual pet toy. The app features interactive elements allowing users to feed, play with, and clean their virtual pet, while monitoring its health, hunger, and cleanliness.

**User Interface (UI):**
The UI is the first point of interaction with the user, hence it must be:
- **Engaging**: The interface should captivate the user’s attention and be enjoyable to interact with.
- **Welcoming**: The design should make new users feel at ease, guiding them intuitively through the app’s features.
- **Responsive**: The pet’s image must change to reflect different actions, providing immediate visual feedback to the user’s inputs.

**Welcome Screen Logic:**
The welcome screen serves as the gateway to the app:
- **Pet Image**: A friendly image of the virtual pet greets the user.
- **Welcome Message**: A warm message welcomes users, setting the tone for the app.
- **Navigation Button**: A clearly marked button takes the user to the main game screen.

**Second Screen Logic:**
This screen is where users interact with their pet:
- **Pet Interaction**: Users can see their pet and interact with it through three main actions: feeding, cleaning, and playing.
- **Action Buttons**: Each button is linked to a specific pet care task and updates the pet’s status accordingly.
- **Status Indicators**: Visual indicators display the pet’s health, hunger, and cleanliness, changing in real-time as the user cares for the pet.

**Version Control with GitHub:**
Using GitHub ensures that the development process is well-documented and version-controlled:
- **Repository**: A dedicated repository on GitHub hosts the app’s codebase.
- **Commits**: Regular commits track changes and progress.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows help in building and testing the app, ensuring code integrity and functionality.

**Testing and Automated Testing:**
Quality assurance is critical:
- **Manual Testing**: The app undergoes rigorous manual testing to ensure all features work as intended.
- **Automated Testing**: GitHub Actions automate the build and test processes, catching issues early and often.

**Documentation:**
Comprehensive documentation is essential for future development and user support:
- **Purpose and Design**: The README file explains the app’s purpose and design considerations.
- **GitHub and GitHub Actions**: The use of version control and automated testing is detailed, providing insights into the development workflow.

In conclusion, the Tamagotchi app for Android is designed to be a fun and engaging way to care for a virtual pet. The development process focuses on creating an intuitive user experience, backed by robust testing and documentation practices. This report outlines the thoughtful approach taken to bring a piece of ‘90s nostalgia to the modern smartphone era.
